# astro's scripts
### I made these somehow (with some ctrl+c and ctrl+v of course)

All of my scripts I make at school in my free time and at home when I'm bored. Seperated by programming language and some dependencies.
I am new to programming so if there are any edits you would like to make to the scripts to make them better, feel free to do so.


## Recommended stuff to install and where to find them (other than the base programming languages)

### pip
manim
art
